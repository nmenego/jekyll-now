Genesis 26 talks about a famine that hit during the time of Isaac, and how he lied to Abimelek (king of the Philistines) about how Rebekah was his sister (actually his wife). The chapter was challenging to read, especially in the lens of the 21st century. One would ask: how could a supposedly man of God deny his wife to save his own butt? Why did God have a need for Isaac to go to Gerar, instead of just stopping the famine?

My takeaway is this: we as Christians can learn a thing or two from non-believers. Because of Isaac’s fears, he was willing to endanger his own wife despite the fact that it was God who sent him there. Abimilek rebuked Isaac – telling him that he has risked both Rebekah and the Philistines because of the lie. Although a pagan king, Abimilek chose to protect Isaac and Rebekah for fear of God’s wrath. Even in the midst of sinful conduct, Isaac was spared.
