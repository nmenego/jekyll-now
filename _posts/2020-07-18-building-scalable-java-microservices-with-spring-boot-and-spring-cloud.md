title: Course Review - Building Scalable Java Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud
tags: course-review java spring google-cloud

Today, wanted to explore some GCP tools out of interest. As we use mostly AWS solutions at work, I never really had the chance to test out Google's offerings. I found this random course in Coursera: [Building Scalable Java Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-cloud-java-spring). 

What's nice about this course is that the laboratory exercises are prepared by [Qwiklabs](https://www.qwiklabs.com/) and that the student is actually presented with a real hands-on GCP environment to play around with. I managed to go through all the labs in one day, while watching Hamilton movie and waiting for the GCP resources to finish loading. I wanted to highlight the things I liked and disliked about the course in this post.

## Pros
1. Covers a lot of ground for a short amount of time.
2. Laboratories are very effective in making you familiar of the GCP console.
3. Really easy to follow the laboratories. It's practically copy-pasting stuff from guide to code.

## Cons
1. Some topics were too shallow, and that no links to further readings or entries were given.
2. Kubernetes and Prometheus topics felt a bit rushed. Lacked discussions to drive points accross.
3. A lot of waiting to load all of the resources when starting up a lab. For example, the base code used for the labs are generated in g3 when you start the exercise. This takes 5-10 minutes while waiting for the bucket to be built. I feel that having it hosted in Github might have been better for time-sensitive students.

Overall, it was a positive experience. I learned a lot about GCP, and it gave me more confidence to be able to deploy stuff in that platform when the time comes. There's also a bonus [certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/FJSBWGK2CUCF)!
