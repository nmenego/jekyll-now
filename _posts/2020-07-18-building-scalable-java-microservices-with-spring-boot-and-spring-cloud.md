title: Course Review - Building Scalable Java Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud
tags: course-review java spring google-cloud

Today, wanted to explore some GCP tools out of interest. As we use mostly AWS solutions at work, I never really had the chance to test out Google's offerings.

I found this random course in Coursera: [Building Scalable Java Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-cloud-java-spring). I managed to go through all the labs in one day, whilst watching Hamilton movie while the waiting on some commands to finish. This was because some of the lab exercises required some waiting time to be able to load all resources. (More on this on stuff I did not like)

## Pros
1. Covers a lot of ground for a short amount of time.
2. Laboratories are very effective in making you familiar of the GCP console.
3. Really easy to follow the laboratories. It's practically copy-pasting stuff from guide to code.

## Cons
1. Some topics were too shallow, and that no links to further readings or entries were given.
2. Kubernetes and Prometheus topics felt a bit rushed. Lacked discussions to drive points accross.
3. A lot of waiting to load all of the resources when starting up a lab. For example, the base code used for the labs are generated in g3 when you start the exercise. This takes 5-10 minutes while waiting for the bucket to be built. I feel that having it hosted in Github might have been better for time-sensitive students.

Overall, it was a positive experience. I learned a lot about GCP, and it gave me more confidence to be able to deploy stuff in that platform when the time comes. There's also a bonus [certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/FJSBWGK2CUCF)!
