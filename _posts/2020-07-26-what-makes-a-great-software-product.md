title: What makes a great software product?

One of the things I learned while taking the [Software Product Management Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/product-management) offered by Coursera, was on the topic of what makes great software products great. One of the key points discussed repeatedly is that: A great software product is one that has the right product, done right and managed right.

## The right product
The right product answers a specific need (or want) from a customer. It addresses pain points that could be alleviated with the help of technology. As a tech-enthusiast, many times I'm attracted to the shiniest technologies, and implementing tools/systems on top of those technologies/platforns. This does not make the product I make 'right' in the sense that it does not necessarily solve a customer's need. In product development, we always have to keep our end-users in mind, and how the product we build can bring a net-positive in their lives.

## Done right
A lot of start-ups with promising products fail because of execution. I personally have experienced this first-hand in one of the start-ups I've been with in my career. It's not enough to have that brilliant idea, the process is vital to success as well. This leads us to the third point...

## Managed right
In order to execute effectively, the product should be managed correctly. Planning, team coordination, and effective leadership are key points in managing a software product correctly.

The courses in the specialization are sized just right, not too big to take most of your time, and not too small to be trivial. I appreciate the different peer-reviewed assignments as well, which really gives the learner some practical skills to apply what they learn. Learned so many things in this specialization, and if you're a developer who wants to expand knowledge in product managent, then the course is definitely a good start.
