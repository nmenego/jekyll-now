If you're wondering, `TIL` is internet-speak for `Today I Learned`. This blog is intended to be a repository of learnings in tech, coding, readings, and all other things that interests me. 

## About Me: Nico Martin Eñego

I'm a Software Engineer passionate about creating disruptive tech that improves people's lives around the world. I am experienced in multiple business domains, including financial technologies, medical technologies, e-commerce, and education. I have multiple years of full-stack experience in different web and mobile technologies.

I love coffee and anything outdoors. I'm passionate about environmental conservation and sustainability, and the alleviation of poverty.

I'm always up for a meaningful conversation if you are as interested as me about the matters above. So don't hesitate to drop me an email here in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nmenego/)!
